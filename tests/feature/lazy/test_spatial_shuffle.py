"""Tests for :meth:`LazyFeatureCollection.spatial_shuffle`.

DASK-24 + DASK-24F: spatial_shuffle moved from a classmethod on
:class:`FeatureCollection` consuming a raw dask GDF to an instance
method on :class:`~pyramids.feature.LazyFeatureCollection`. The
classmethod form is deleted outright — no back-compat alias per the
branch's refactor policy.

Validation paths that previously ran without dask-geopandas (TypeError
on bad input, ImportError on missing dep) no longer apply: the
instance method is only reachable from a LazyFC, which itself requires
the ``[parquet-lazy]`` extra.

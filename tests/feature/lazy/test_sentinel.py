"""L3: PEP-562 ``__getattr__`` hook on :mod:`pyramids.feature`.

The module exposes ``LazyFeatureCollection`` via a package-level
``__getattr__`` rather than a plain ``None`` sentinel. Pin the two
behaviours this buys us:

1. On a full install (dask-geopandas present), the symbol resolves to
   the real class.
2. On a minimal install, ``from pyramids.feature import
   LazyFeatureCollection`` raises a branded :class:`ImportError` with
   the install hint. Library authors who need to dispatch across both
   minimal and full installs guard with ``try/except ImportError`` or
   read the ``_HAS_DASK_GEOPANDAS`` flag directly (``hasattr`` does
   NOT catch ``ImportError`` in Python 3 — it only catches
   ``AttributeError`` — so the raising ``__getattr__`` surfaces the
   error at the access site, which is the intended UX).

The minimal-install path is simulated by patching
:data:`pyramids.feature._HAS_DASK_GEOPANDAS` so the test runs regardless
of which extras are installed in the dev env.

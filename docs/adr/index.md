# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section collects significant architectural decisions for the pyramids project, using the MADR format.

- ADR-0001: Docs stack
- ADR-0002: Type checking approach
- ADR-0003: I/O format choices
- ADR-0004: Dependency graphing approach
- ADR-0005: Versioned documentation strategy

Each ADR includes context, decision, and consequences. New ADRs should follow the numbering convention and be immutable once accepted.

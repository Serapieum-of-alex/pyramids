# Installation

pyramids-gis ships **self-contained platform wheels** on PyPI that bundle
the GDAL/OGR/PROJ/GEOS native libraries. `pip install pyramids-gis`
works out of the box on Linux, macOS, and Windows — no system GDAL
installation required.

**Package name:** `pyramids-gis`
**Supported Python versions:** 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 (requires `>=3.11,<4`)

## Quick install (recommended for most users)

### With pip (PyPI platform wheels)

```console
pip install pyramids-gis
```

That's it. The wheel includes GDAL 3.12, PROJ, GEOS, HDF4/5, NetCDF,
libtiff, and all other native dependencies. No `gdal-config`, no
`apt install libgdal-dev`, no OSGeo4W installer needed.

Optional extras:

```console
pip install "pyramids-gis[viz]"      # cleopatra plotting support
pip install "pyramids-gis[xarray]"   # xarray / NetCDF4 interop
```

### With conda-forge

```console
conda install -c conda-forge pyramids
```

conda-forge gets native GDAL via conda itself (not bundled in the
package). Use this if you're already in a conda/mamba environment.

### With pixi

```console
pixi add pyramids-gis
```

## Verify the install

Open Python and run:

```python
import pyramids
from osgeo import gdal
print(pyramids.__version__)
print(gdal.__version__)          # should print 3.12.x
```

## Platform support matrix

| Platform | Architecture | Wheel tag | Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Linux (glibc ≥ 2.39) | x86_64 | `manylinux_2_39_x86_64` | ✅ Supported |
| Linux (glibc < 2.39) | x86_64 | — | ❌ Fall back to conda |
| Linux | aarch64 | — | 🔵 Planned |
| macOS 11+ | x86_64 | `macosx_11_0_x86_64` | ✅ Supported |
| macOS 11+ | arm64 (Apple Silicon) | `macosx_11_0_arm64` | ✅ Supported |
| Windows 10+ | x64 | `win_amd64` | ✅ Supported |
| Alpine (musl) | any | — | 🔵 Planned |

Distros covered by the Linux wheel out of the box:

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and newer
- Debian 13 (trixie) and newer
- RHEL / Rocky / Alma Linux 10 and newer
- Fedora 39 and newer
- Arch Linux (rolling)

If your distro has **glibc < 2.39**, use the conda-forge path instead.

## System dependencies

The wheel bundles nearly everything. The only system dependencies are
standard C runtime libraries that every Linux distro ships:

- `libc.so.6`, `libm.so.6`, `libpthread.so.0`, `libdl.so.2` (glibc)
- `libexpat.so.1` (XML parsing — on **minimal** Debian/Alpine images this
  may need `apt-get install libexpat1`; full distros have it)
- `libgcc_s.so.1`, `libstdc++.so.6` (GCC runtime)

On Docker `python:3.12-slim`:

```console
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libexpat1
pip install pyramids-gis
```

No other system packages are required.

## Editable / development install

For contributing to pyramids-gis, use pixi (which manages GDAL via
conda-forge for development):

```console
git clone https://github.com/Serapieum-of-alex/pyramids.git
cd pyramids
pixi install -e dev
pixi run -e dev pip install -e .
pixi run -e dev main      # runs the main test suite
```

Pixi environments available:

| Environment | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `dev` | Default development env (includes viz + xarray + test tooling) |
| `docs` | Documentation toolchain (mkdocs + plugins) |
| `py311`, `py312`, `py313`, `py314` | Single-Python-version test envs |
| `wheel-build` | Minimal env used by cibuildwheel to obtain native GDAL |

## Install from source (no pixi)

If you're not using pixi and want to install from source, you'll need
the native GDAL library available at configure time (because the sdist
does **not** include it — only the PyPI wheel does).

```console
# 1. Install native GDAL via your system package manager first
# (see Platform-specific: no wheel available below)

# 2. Then install pyramids-gis from source
git clone https://github.com/Serapieum-of-alex/pyramids.git
cd pyramids
pip install .
```

## Platform-specific: no wheel available

If you're on a platform we don't ship a wheel for (e.g., Linux aarch64,
musllinux/Alpine, glibc < 2.39), pip will try to build pyramids-gis
from the sdist. That requires a pre-installed native GDAL:

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
pip install pyramids-gis
```

### Linux (Fedora/RHEL/Rocky)

```console
sudo dnf install gdal gdal-devel
pip install pyramids-gis
```

### macOS (Homebrew)

```console
brew install gdal
pip install pyramids-gis
```

### Windows without a wheel

Use conda or pixi — installing GDAL natively on Windows is impractical.

## Install directly from GitHub

Latest `main`:

```console
pip install "git+https://github.com/Serapieum-of-alex/pyramids.git"
```

A specific tagged release:

```console
pip install "git+https://github.com/Serapieum-of-alex/pyramids.git@<version>"
```

Note: this installs from the sdist, not a wheel, so the same
pre-installed-native-GDAL caveat applies.

runtime issues.

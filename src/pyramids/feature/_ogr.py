"""Private OGR bridge for :mod:`pyramids.feature`.

This module is **not part of the public API**. It exists solely so that
``FeatureCollection`` methods that internally need a GDAL/OGR object
(for example :func:`osgeo.gdal.Rasterize` or :func:`osgeo.gdal.Warp` with
``cutlineDSName``) can obtain one without leaking ``ogr.DataSource`` or
``gdal.Dataset`` into the package's public surface.

All helpers in this module are context-managed where possible so that the
backing ``/vsimem/`` file and the OGR handle are deterministically
released when the ``with`` block exits.

Do not import this module from user code; its signatures are unstable.

    """Return a fresh unique ``/vsimem/`` path for a GeoJSON serialization.

    The path is unique per call (UUID4) so that concurrent internal
    conversions cannot clobber each other's backing files.

    Returns:
        str: A ``/vsimem/<uuid>.geojson`` path.

    Examples:
        - Check the shape of a freshly generated path:
            ```python

            ```
        - Two successive calls return distinct paths (UUID4 collision is
          astronomically unlikely) so concurrent conversions cannot

def as_datasource(
    gdf: GeoDataFrame, *, gdal_dataset: bool = False
) -> Iterator[ogr.DataSource | gdal.Dataset]:
    """Yield a short-lived OGR ``DataSource`` for a GeoDataFrame.

    The DataSource (or ``gdal.Dataset`` with OGR contents when
    ``gdal_dataset=True``) is backed by an in-memory ``/vsimem/`` GeoJSON
    file that is unlinked when the context exits. The caller must use the
    yielded object only inside the ``with`` block — storing it past the
    block is a use-after-free.

    Args:
        gdf (GeoDataFrame):
            The GeoDataFrame to expose as an OGR DataSource. Any subclass
            of :class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` is accepted — in particular
            ``pyramids.feature.FeatureCollection`` works unchanged since
            it IS a ``GeoDataFrame``.
        gdal_dataset (bool):
            When ``True``, yield a ``gdal.Dataset`` (opened via
            :func:`gdal.OpenEx`) instead of an ``ogr.DataSource``. This
            is the form required by :func:`gdal.Rasterize` when the
            vector argument is a Python GDAL object rather than a path.

    Yields:
        ogr.DataSource | gdal.Dataset: A short-lived handle to the vector
        data. Do not store past the ``with`` block.

    Raises:
        VectorDriverError: If :func:`gdal.OpenEx` / :func:`ogr.Open`
            returns ``None`` after the in-memory GeoJSON was written —
            usually the GeoDataFrame has malformed geometry or an
            unsupported CRS. The message includes the ``/vsimem/``
            path for debugging (C4).

    Notes:
        Cleanup is exception-safe. If ``gdf.to_json`` or
        :func:`gdal.FileFromMemBuffer` raises before the in-memory file
        is written, the ``finally`` block does **not** call
        :func:`gdal.Unlink` on a non-existent path (tracked via an
        internal ``file_written`` flag). When the user's ``with`` body
        raises, the path is still unlinked exactly once (C4).

    Examples:
        - Open a GeoDataFrame as an OGR DataSource inside a ``with``
          block, and confirm the yielded handle exposes one layer with
          the feature count the GDF had:
            ```python
            >>> import geopandas as gpd
            >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
            >>> from pyramids.feature._ogr import as_datasource

            ...     {"v": [1, 2]},
            ...     geometry=[Point(0, 0), Point(1, 1)],
            ...     crs="EPSG:4326",
            ... )
            >>> with as_datasource(gdf) as ds:
            ...     layer = ds.GetLayer(0)
            ...     n_features = layer.GetFeatureCount()
            >>> n_features
            2

            ```
        - Request a ``gdal.Dataset`` instead of an ``ogr.DataSource``
          (the form :func:`gdal.Rasterize` expects when its vector
          argument is a Python GDAL object rather than a file path):
            ```python
            >>> import geopandas as gpd

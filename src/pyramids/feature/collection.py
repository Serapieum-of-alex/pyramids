"""FeatureCollection — a GeoDataFrame with pyramids-specific GIS methods.

ARC-10 split the original ``feature.py`` into a subpackage:

- :mod:`pyramids.feature.collection` (this module) — the
  :class:`FeatureCollection` class.
- :mod:`pyramids.feature.geometry` — shape factories and coordinate
  extractors (``create_polygon``, ``create_point``, ``get_coords``,
  ``explode_gdf``, ``multi_geom_handler``, …).
- :mod:`pyramids.feature._ogr` — private OGR bridge.

CRS / EPSG / reprojection helpers (``get_epsg_from_prj``,
``reproject_coordinates``, ``create_sr_from_proj``) live in
:mod:`pyramids.base.crs`. The :class:`FeatureCollection` class
exposes the most-commonly-used ones as static-method delegates for
ergonomic continuity.

``FeatureCollection`` is a direct subclass of
:class:`geopandas.GeoDataFrame` (ARC-1a). Every GeoDataFrame method
is inherited; pyramids adds rasterization, Dataset interop, vertex
extraction, and CRS-helper delegates on top. ``ogr.DataSource`` is
internal only (ARC-1b); see :mod:`pyramids.feature._ogr`.

.. note::
   Inline comments like ``# C14:``, ``# D-H2:``, ``# D-N4:`` and
   ``# L6:`` are tracker anchors: they point at review issues resolved
   during the ARC-* refactor. The full issue text lives in
   ``planning/feature/pr-review-merged.md`` and
   ``planning/feature/pr-diff-review-2.md``. Grep either file by the
   marker to recover the rationale.

                ``"records"`` (default) or ``"list"`` — matches the
                pandas ``from_dict``/``from_records`` conventions.

        Returns:
            FeatureCollection: A new FC with one row per record.

        Raises:
            FeatureError: If a record is missing the ``geometry``
                column.
            ValueError: If ``orient`` is not one of the supported
                values.

        Examples:
            - Per-row records with the default geometry key:
                ```python
                >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
                >>> from pyramids.feature import FeatureCollection
                >>> recs = [
                ...     {"id": 1, "geometry": Point(0, 0)},
                ...     {"id": 2, "geometry": Point(1, 1)},
                ... ]
                >>> fc = FeatureCollection.from_records(recs, crs=4326)
                >>> len(fc)
                2
                >>> fc.epsg
                4326

                ```
            - Custom geometry key via the ``geometry=`` kwarg:
                ```python
                >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
                >>> from pyramids.feature import FeatureCollection
                >>> recs = [
                ...     {"id": 1, "geom": Point(0, 0)},
                ...     {"id": 2, "geom": Point(1, 1)},
                ... ]
                >>> fc = FeatureCollection.from_records(
                ...     recs, geometry="geom", crs=4326,
                ... )
                >>> fc.geometry.name
                'geom'

                ```
            - Columnar dict via ``orient="list"``:
                ```python
                >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
                >>> from pyramids.feature import FeatureCollection

                >>> list(fc["id"])

        """Stream features from ``path`` without materializing the full file.

        ARC-25 + ARC-34. Two orthogonal knobs:

        * **Chunk shape**. ``chunksize=None`` yields one GeoJSON-style
          dict per row (fiona idiom). ``chunksize=N`` yields
          :class:`FeatureCollection` batches of up to N rows each so
          batched pipelines get a DataFrame-shaped payload.
        * **Tile strategy** (ARC-34). Controls whether the ``bbox``
          filter is pushed into the format's spatial index (rtree on
          GPKG, row-group statistics on Parquet, …) or applied after
          a full scan. Pass one of:

          - ``"auto"`` (default) — let pyogrio pick. For a GPKG,
            pyogrio queries the ``rtree_<layer>_geom`` companion
            table automatically. For a Parquet file, pyogrio /
            pyarrow push the bbox down to the row-group statistics
            and skip non-matching groups. For formats without a
            spatial index (GeoJSON, Shapefile without a ``.qix``)
            this falls back to a full scan in the driver.
          - ``"rtree"`` — same as ``"auto"``; kept as an explicit
            name so pipeline code can document intent.
          - ``"row_group"`` — same as ``"auto"``; explicit name for
            the Parquet case.
          - ``"none"`` — disable index pushdown; read whole chunks
            from the driver and apply the bbox filter in Python.
            Useful when the on-disk spatial index is stale or
            suspected wrong; also exercises the "slow path" in
            tests.

        ``bbox`` / ``where`` compose with any tile_strategy. Paths run
        through :func:`pyramids._io._parse_path` so cloud URLs and
        archive paths work the same way as in :meth:`read_file`.

        Args:
            path (str | Path): File path, URL, archive path.
            layer (str | int | None): Layer selector for multi-layer
                formats.
            bbox: ``(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)`` filter.
            where (str | None): OGR SQL predicate.
            chunksize (int | None): ``None`` yields dicts, an ``int``
                yields ``FeatureCollection`` chunks.
            tile_strategy (str): One of ``"auto"``, ``"rtree"``,
                ``"row_group"``, ``"none"``. Default ``"auto"``.
            include_index (bool): When ``True``, each yielded dict gets
                an additional ``"id"`` key whose value is the
                0-based file-row index of that feature. The chunked
                form (``chunksize=N``) attaches the same index as a
                ``"_row_index"`` column on the yielded FC. The indices
                stay aligned with the on-disk rows even when a
                Python-side bbox filter (``tile_strategy="none"``)
                drops some rows — only the surviving features are
                yielded, and their ids match the positions they had
                in the source file. Defaults to ``False`` for
                back-compat with the fiona idiom.

        Yields:
            dict | FeatureCollection: Per-feature dicts when
            ``chunksize`` is ``None``; FeatureCollection chunks
            otherwise.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``chunksize`` is given but ``< 1``, or if
                ``tile_strategy`` is not one of the accepted values.

        Examples:
            - Stream features one at a time as GeoJSON-style dicts:

                >>> import tempfile

                1

                ```
            - Stream in ``chunksize=2`` batches as FeatureCollection chunks:

                Restrict loaded attribute columns. Geometry is
                always loaded. ``None`` loads every column.

                OGR SQL ``WHERE``-clause predicate pushed down to the

        """EPSG code of this FeatureCollection's CRS (ARC-6 cached).

        The value is cached per CRS-object identity so repeated access
        on hot paths skips the ``pyproj.CRS.to_epsg`` call. The cache
        auto-invalidates whenever ``self.crs`` is replaced.

        C11: identity-miss falls back to equality. If ``self.crs`` has
        been reassigned to a different CRS object that nevertheless
        compares equal to the cached one (e.g. ``fc.crs = pyproj.CRS(
        "EPSG:4326")`` on a frame already in EPSG:4326), we adopt the
        new object as the cache key and skip the ``.to_epsg()`` call.
        Only when the value really differs do we recompute.

        L2: the equality fallback is cheaper than a fresh
        ``.to_epsg()`` (which re-parses the CRS) but it is not free —
        ``pyproj.CRS.__eq__`` does a WKT2 string comparison. If a
        future pandas/geopandas release stops returning the same
        ``self.crs`` object identity across accesses, the fallback
        runs on every ``fc.epsg`` and adds up on hot loops. Switch
        the cache key to ``self.crs.to_wkt()`` if a profile ever
        shows this dominating.

        Returns:
            int | None: The integer EPSG code if the CRS is registered
            in the EPSG authority; ``None`` when the FC has no CRS set
            or when its CRS cannot be mapped to a single EPSG code.

        """List every vector-layer name in ``path`` (ARC-27).

        Routes through :func:`pyramids._io._parse_path` so the same
        cloud-URL / archive rewriting that :meth:`read_file` uses
        applies here too. Uses :func:`pyogrio.list_layers` under the
        hood (geopandas' default engine).

        C15: results are memoised behind a 128-entry LRU cache keyed on
        the resolved ``str`` path. Re-calling ``list_layers`` on the
        same cloud URL or local path in a loop now costs one hash
        lookup instead of one datasource open. Call
        :meth:`list_layers_cache_clear` to invalidate after an
        out-of-band write.

        Args:
            path (str | Path):
                File path, URL, or archive path. Single-layer formats
                like GeoJSON return one name; multi-layer formats
                (GPKG, GDB, KML) return every layer.

        Returns:
            list[str]: Layer names in the order the driver reports them.

        Raises:
            FileNotFoundError: If ``path`` is a local filesystem path
                that does not exist. Cloud URLs and ``/vsi*`` paths
                skip this check and defer to the underlying driver
                (C29). Previously all failures surfaced as an opaque
                ``VectorDriverError("Failed to open datasource")``.

        Examples:
            - A single-layer GeoJSON returns one name derived from the filename:

        ARC-26: ``layer``, ``mode``, and arbitrary driver creation
        options are now first-class kwargs. Previously callers had to
        rely on implicit ``**kwargs`` forwarding, which hurt
        discoverability.

        Args:
            path (str | Path):
                Destination file path.
            driver (str):
                Driver alias (e.g. ``"geojson"``, ``"gpkg"``) or
                literal GDAL driver name (``"GeoJSON"``, ``"GPKG"``,
                ``"ESRI Shapefile"``). Resolved via :class:`Catalog`.
            layer (str | None):
                Layer name for multi-layer drivers (GPKG, GDB, …).
                Writing two layers into the same GPKG is the canonical
                use case. ``None`` defers to the driver default.
            mode (str):
                ``"w"`` (default) overwrites; ``"a"`` appends to an
                existing layer. Append support depends on the driver
                — GPKG and Shapefile accept it, GeoJSON does not.
            **creation_options:
                Driver-specific creation options, forwarded to the
                underlying engine (pyogrio / fiona). Examples:

                * GPKG: ``SPATIAL_INDEX="YES"``, ``FID="id"``.
                * Shapefile: ``ENCODING="UTF-8"``.
                * GeoJSON: ``COORDINATE_PRECISION=6``, ``RFC7946=YES``.

                Keys are case-preserving and passed verbatim to the
                driver; consult the GDAL driver docs for the full
                list.

                C8: pyogrio (the default geopandas engine on 1.0+)
                raises :class:`ValueError` with the message
                ``"unrecognized option '<name>' for driver '<driver>'"``
                when a supplied option is neither in the driver's
                dataset nor its layer creation-option list. This
                surfaces typos (``SPATIAL_INDX`` vs ``SPATIAL_INDEX``)
                at write-time rather than silently producing a
                different file. Some drivers may still accept options
                that pyogrio does not list — verify against the
                driver's docs when in doubt.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``mode`` isn't ``"w"`` or ``"a"``, or if a
                supplied creation option is not recognised by the
                driver (raised by pyogrio — see the ``**creation_options``
                note above).

        Examples:
            - Round-trip a small FC through GeoJSON (the default driver):
                ```python
                >>> import tempfile

                ['id', 'geometry']

            - Write to GeoPackage with a named layer:

                >>> FeatureCollection.list_layers(path)
                ['rivers']

                ```

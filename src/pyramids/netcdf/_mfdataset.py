"""Multi-file NetCDF opener with optional parallel metadata fan-out.

DASK-12: ``NetCDF.open_mfdataset(paths, variable, ...)`` opens many
NetCDF files and stacks a single named variable into a single lazy
:class:`dask.array.Array` of shape
``(n_files, *variable_shape)`` — the canonical shape for a set of
daily / hourly gridded files.

Unlike :func:`xarray.open_mfdataset`, this helper is deliberately
narrow: one variable at a time, no "by_coords" inference, no combine
strategies. For the common hydrology / meteorology case (open 365
noah_YYYYMMDD.nc files, stack the ``precipitation`` variable, reduce
along time) that narrowness is the whole point — no metadata
inference means no failure modes when one file has a different
schema.

``parallel=True`` wraps each file's metadata read in
:func:`dask.delayed`, so opening 500 files on a distributed cluster
fans out over workers rather than blocking sequentially.

    Args:
        paths: Glob string (``"noah_*.nc"``), an explicit file path, or
            a sequence of paths. Glob inputs are expanded and sorted
            alphabetically so the stack order is deterministic.
        variable: Name of the NetCDF variable to extract from each
            file. Must exist in every file with the same spatial
            shape + dtype; mismatches produce a :class:`ValueError`
            from :func:`dask.array.stack` at graph-construction time.
        chunks: Chunk specification forwarded to
            :meth:`NetCDF.read_array` when reading each file. ``None``
            uses each variable's native on-disk chunking.
        parallel: When ``True``, wraps the per-file open+extract in
            :func:`dask.delayed` so the reads fan out across a dask
            scheduler. Default ``False`` reads sequentially.
        preprocess: Optional callable applied to each
            :class:`NetCDF` subset before its array is extracted —
            for example to unpack scale/offset, crop, or drop
            auxiliary variables.

    Returns:
        dask.array.Array: A stack of shape ``(n_files, *var_shape)``.
        Element ``[i, ...]`` corresponds to ``paths[i]`` (after glob
        expansion + sort).

    Raises:
        ImportError: When dask is not installed.
        FileNotFoundError: When ``paths`` is an explicit path that
            does not exist.

        - Stack a single file into a 1-element dask array:
            ```python

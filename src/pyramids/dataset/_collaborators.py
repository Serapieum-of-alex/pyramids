"""Collaborator objects for Dataset operations (L-2 Stage 1 stubs).

The L-2 composition refactor (see
``planning/architecture-review/L-2-dataset-mixin-refactor.md``)
replaces the seven mixins inherited by ``Dataset`` with seven
collaborator instances accessible as ``ds.io``, ``ds.spatial``,
``ds.bands``, ``ds.analysis``, ``ds.cell``, ``ds.vectorize``,
``ds.cog``. During Stage 1 the collaborators are forwarder stubs
— each method delegates back to ``self._ds.<method>(...)``, which
resolves to the existing mixin via the unchanged MRO. Stage 2
PRs migrate method bodies into the collaborators one at a time
and remove the corresponding mixin from ``Dataset``'s base list.

Three design notes:

1.  **Back-reference**. Every collaborator holds ``self._ds``,
    a reference to the parent Dataset. Operations that need
    state (``self._ds.crs``, ``self._ds._raster``) reach through
    that handle.
2.  **Pickle**. Collaborators are NOT pickled as state.
    ``Dataset.__reduce__`` short-circuits the entire pickle graph
    (verified in the Stage 0 audit, §3) and reconstructs via
    ``cls.read_file(...)``, which calls ``Dataset.__init__``,
    which creates fresh collaborators on the new instance. The
    defensive ``_Collaborator.__reduce__`` returning a
    ``_Placeholder`` is only needed if a caller pickles a
    collaborator *directly* — e.g. ``pickle.dumps(ds.io)``.
3.  **Naming**. The collaborator class names (``IO``, ``Spatial``,
    ``Bands``, ``Analysis``, ``Cell``, ``Vectorize``, ``COG``)
    intentionally collide with the existing mixin classes for
    five of the seven. ``dataset.py`` resolves the collision by
    importing the mixin classes under ``_<X>Mixin`` aliases.

Method-level docstrings on the forwarders are intentionally
one-liners that reference the canonical implementation on
``Dataset``. Duplicating the full Args/Returns/Examples blocks on
both the mixin method and the forwarder would create two sources
of truth that drift apart; readers who need the contract should
follow the cross-reference.

        Data Chuncks/blocks
            When a raster dataset is stored on disk, it might not be stored as one continuous chunk of data. Instead,
            it can be divided into smaller rectangular blocks or tiles. These blocks can be individually accessed,
            which is particularly useful for large datasets:

                - Efficiency: Reading or writing small blocks requires less memory than dealing with the entire
                      dataset at once. This is especially beneficial when only a small portion of the data needs
                      to be processed.
                - Performance: For certain file formats and operations, working with optimal block sizes can
                      significantly improve performance. For example, if the block size matches the reading or
                      processing window, Pyramids can minimize disk access and data transfer.

        Args:
            band (int, optional):
                The band you want to get its data. If None, data of all bands will be read. Default is None.
            window (List[int] | GeoDataFrame, optional):
                Specify a block of data to read from the dataset. The window can be specified in two ways:

                - List:
                    Window specified as a list of 4 integers [offset_x, offset_y, window_columns, window_rows].

                    - offset_x/column index: x offset of the block.
                    - offset_y/row index: y offset of the block.
                    - window_columns: number of columns in the block.
                    - window_rows: number of rows in the block.

                - GeoDataFrame:
                    GeoDataFrame with a geometry column filled with polygon geometries; the function will get the
                    total_bounds of the GeoDataFrame and use it as a window to read the raster.
            chunks (int | tuple | dict | str | None, keyword-only):
                Controls the backing array type. ``None`` (the default)
                preserves the eager numpy path — no behavior change
                relative to earlier releases, and ``dask`` is not
                imported. Any other value switches to a lazy
                :class:`dask.array.Array` whose blocks are materialized
                on demand via a pickle-safe chunk reader:

                - ``"auto"`` lets dask pick chunk shapes that keep each
                  block near the default dask chunk-byte target while
                  aligning with the on-disk block layout.
                - ``-1`` produces a single chunk that covers the whole
                  array — useful to defer the read but materialize in
                  one shot.
                - An int (e.g. ``512``) applies to every dimension.
                - A tuple (e.g. ``(1, 512, 512)``) gives per-dimension
                  sizes.
                - A dict (e.g. ``{0: 1, 1: 512, 2: 512}``) maps
                  dimension index to chunk size.

                When ``chunks`` is non-None and ``dask`` is not
                installed, :class:`ImportError` is raised pointing at
                the ``[lazy]`` extra. ``window`` is **not** supported
                together with ``chunks``; raise :class:`ValueError`
                otherwise.
            lock (optional, keyword-only):
                Thread / process lock guarding concurrent GDAL reads
                of the same handle.

                - ``None`` (default) → :func:`pyramids.base._locks.default_lock` —
                  :class:`SerializableLock` in a single-process context,
                  ``dask.distributed.Lock`` when a running client is
                  detected.
                - ``False`` → :class:`~pyramids.base._locks.DummyLock`
                  for lock-free reads (per-thread handle; no mutex).
                - Any other object with ``acquire``/``release`` /
                  context-manager semantics is used as-is.

                Ignored when ``chunks is None``.

        Returns:
            ArrayLike:
                :class:`numpy.ndarray` when ``chunks is None``,
                :class:`dask.array.Array` otherwise. The instance
                attribute :attr:`_backend` records ``"numpy"`` or
                ``"dask"`` after the call.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If ``band`` is out of range or ``chunks`` is
                combined with ``window`` (the lazy path reads the
                full array and expects dask to slice it down).
            ImportError: If ``chunks`` is non-None and ``dask`` is not
                installed.

        Examples:
            - Create `Dataset` consisting of 4 bands, 5 rows, and 5 columns at the point lon/lat (0, 0):

              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> arr = np.random.rand(4, 5, 5)
              >>> top_left_corner = (0, 0)
              >>> cell_size = 0.05
              >>> dataset = Dataset.create_from_array(
              ...     arr, top_left_corner=top_left_corner, cell_size=cell_size, epsg=4326,
              ... )

              ```

            - Read all the values stored in a given band:

              ```python
              >>> arr = dataset.read_array(band=0) # doctest: +SKIP
              array([[0.50482225, 0.45678043, 0.53294294, 0.28862223, 0.66753579],
                     [0.38471912, 0.14617829, 0.05045189, 0.00761358, 0.25501918],
                     [0.32689036, 0.37358843, 0.32233918, 0.75450564, 0.45197608],
                     [0.22944676, 0.2780928 , 0.71605189, 0.71859309, 0.61896933],
                     [0.47740168, 0.76490779, 0.07679277, 0.16142599, 0.73630836]])

              ```

            - Read a 2x2 block from the first band. The block starts at the 2nd column (index 1) and 2nd row (index 1)
                (the first index is the column index):

              ```python
              >>> arr = dataset.read_array(band=0, window=[1, 1, 2, 2])
              >>> print(arr) # doctest: +SKIP
              array([[0.14617829, 0.05045189],
                     [0.37358843, 0.32233918]])

              ```

            - If you check the values of the 2x2 block, you will find them the same as the values in the entire array
                of band 0, starting at the 2nd row and 2nd column.

            - Read a block using a GeoDataFrame polygon that covers the same area as the window above:

              ```python
              >>> import geopandas as gpd
              >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
              >>> poly = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
              ...     geometry=[Polygon([(0.1, -0.1), (0.1, -0.2), (0.2, -0.2), (0.2, -0.1)])],
              ...     crs=4326,
              ... )
              >>> arr = dataset.read_array(band=0, window=poly)
              >>> print(arr) # doctest: +SKIP
              array([[0.14617829, 0.05045189],
                     [0.37358843, 0.32233918]])

                from the file extension. Use ``driver="COG"`` to write
                a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF; the call delegates to
                :meth:`~pyramids.dataset.ops.cog.COGMixin.to_cog`:

                - ``creation_options`` (list form) is forwarded as the
                  ``extra`` argument.
                - ``tile_length`` is forwarded as the COG
                  ``blocksize`` parameter.
                - ``band`` must be ``0`` (COG writes all bands); any
                  other value raises :class:`ValueError`.

                Default ``None`` preserves the existing
                extension-based driver selection.
            compute (bool, keyword-only):
                ``True`` (default) writes the file synchronously and
                returns ``None`` — behavior identical to earlier
                releases. ``False`` returns a
                :class:`dask.delayed.Delayed` object that defers the
                write until the caller invokes ``.compute()`` on it.
                Useful for composing a pyramids write into a larger
                dask task graph (for example, reading with
                ``read_array(chunks=...)``, transforming lazily, then
                writing in the same compute).
            lock (Any, keyword-only):
                Optional lock object reserved for cluster-wide write
                coordination. GeoTIFF writes are serialized by GDAL's
                own file lock regardless, so this kwarg is currently a
                no-op — supplied for rioxarray API parity and to
                future-proof the signature for when we add per-tile
                parallel writes.

        Examples:
            - Create a Dataset with 4 bands, 5 rows, 5 columns, at the point lon/lat (0, 0):

              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> arr = np.random.rand(4, 5, 5)
              >>> top_left_corner = (0, 0)

          applies ``func`` to each tile, and writes the result into a fresh
          in-memory Dataset. Neither input nor output needs to fit in RAM at
          once. Returns a :class:`~pyramids.dataset.Dataset`.
        - ``chunks=<spec>``: reads lazily via
          :meth:`read_array(chunks=<spec>) <pyramids.dataset.ops.io.IO.read_array>`
          and dispatches to :func:`dask.array.map_blocks`. Returns a
          :class:`dask.array.Array` that materializes on ``.compute()`` or
          when wrapped by another lazy pyramids op. ``dtype``, ``drop_axis``,
          and ``new_axis`` are forwarded to dask.

        Args:
            func (Callable[[np.ndarray], np.ndarray]):
                A function that takes a numpy array (the tile) and returns a numpy array
                of the same shape. The function should handle no-data values internally
                if needed.
            tile_size (int):
                Size of each square tile in pixels when ``chunks=None``. Default is 256.
                Ignored on the lazy path (use ``chunks=`` instead).
            band (int | None):
                Band index to process. If None, all bands are processed. Default is None.
            chunks (keyword-only):
                If given, switches to the lazy path and is forwarded to
                ``read_array(chunks=...)`` — see that method for accepted
                values. ``None`` (default) keeps the eager block loop.
            dtype (np.dtype | None, keyword-only):
                Output dtype. Defaults to the input array dtype. Matches
                :func:`dask.array.map_blocks` ``dtype=``. Lazy path only.
            drop_axis (keyword-only):
                Axes dropped by ``func``. Matches dask's ``drop_axis=``.
                Lazy path only.
            new_axis (keyword-only):
                Axes added by ``func``. Matches dask's ``new_axis=``.
                Lazy path only.

        Returns:
            Dataset or dask.array.Array:
                - Eager path returns a :class:`Dataset` with the function
                  applied to every tile.
                - Lazy path returns a :class:`dask.array.Array`.

                "AVERAGE_MAGPHASE", "RMS", "BILINEAR". Defaults to "nearest".
            overview_levels (list, optional):
                The overview levels. Restricted to typical power-of-two reduction factors. Defaults to [2, 4, 8, 16,
                32].
        Returns:
            None:
                Creates internal or external overviews depending on the dataset access mode. See Notes.
        Notes:
            - External (.ovr file): If the dataset is read with `read_only=True` then the overviews file will be created
              as an external .ovr file in the same directory of the dataset.
            - Internal: If the dataset is read with `read_only=False` then the overviews will be created internally in
              the dataset, and the dataset needs to be saved/flushed to persist the changes to disk.
            - You can check the count per band via the `overview_count` property.
        Examples:
            - Create a Dataset with 4 bands, 10 rows, 10 columns, at the point lon/lat (0, 0):
              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> arr = np.random.rand(4, 10, 10)
              >>> top_left_corner = (0, 0)
              >>> cell_size = 0.05
              >>> dataset = Dataset.create_from_array(arr, top_left_corner=top_left_corner, cell_size=cell_size, epsg=4326)
              ```
            - Now, create overviews using the default parameters:
              ```python
              >>> dataset.create_overviews()
              >>> print(dataset.overview_count)  # doctest: +SKIP
              [4, 4, 4, 4]
              ```
            - For each band, there are 4 overview levels you can use to plot the bands:
              ```python
              >>> dataset.plot(band=0, overview=True, overview_index=0) # doctest: +SKIP
              ```
              ![overviews-level-0](./../../_images/dataset/overviews-level-0.png)
            - However, the dataset originally is 10*10, but the first overview level (2) displays half of the cells by
              aggregating all the cells using the nearest neighbor. The second level displays only 3 cells in each:
              ```python
              >>> dataset.plot(band=0, overview=True, overview_index=1)   # doctest: +SKIP
              ```
              ![overviews-level-1](./../../_images/dataset/overviews-level-1.png)
            - For the third overview level:
              ```python
              >>> dataset.plot(band=0, overview=True, overview_index=2)       # doctest: +SKIP
              ```

                Include the cells that touch the polygon, not only those that lie entirely inside the polygon mask.

        Returns:
            Dataset:
                A new cropped Dataset.

        Hint:
            - If the mask is a dataset with multi-bands, the `crop` method will use the first band as the mask.

        Examples:
            - Crop the raster using a polygon mask.

              - The polygon covers 4 cells in the 3rd and 4th rows and 3rd and 4th column `arr[2:4, 2:4]`, so the result
                dataset will have the same number of bands `4`, 2 rows and 2 columns.
              - First, create the dataset to have 4 bands, 10 rows and 10 columns; the dataset has a cell size of 0.05
                degree, the top left corner of the dataset is (0, 0).

              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> import geopandas as gpd
              >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
              >>> arr = np.random.rand(4, 10, 10)
              >>> cell_size = 0.05
              >>> top_left_corner = (0, 0)
              >>> dataset = Dataset.create_from_array(
              ...         arr, top_left_corner=top_left_corner, cell_size=cell_size, epsg=4326
              ... )

              ```
            - Second, create the polygon using shapely polygon, and use the xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax = [0.1, -0.2, 0.2 -0.1]
                to cover the 4 cells.

                ```python
                >>> mask = gpd.GeoDataFrame(geometry=[Polygon([(0.1, -0.1), (0.1, -0.2), (0.2, -0.2), (0.2, -0.1)])], crs=4326)

                ```
            - Pass the `geodataframe` to the crop method using the `mask` parameter.

              ```python
              >>> cropped_dataset = dataset.crop(mask=mask)

              ```
            - Check the cropped dataset:

              ```python
              >>> print(cropped_dataset.shape)
              (4, 2, 2)
              >>> print(cropped_dataset.geotransform)
              (0.1, 0.05, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, -0.05)
              >>> print(cropped_dataset.read_array(band=0))# doctest: +SKIP
              [[0.00921161 0.90841171]
               [0.355636   0.18650262]]
              >>> print(arr[0, 2:4, 2:4])# doctest: +SKIP
              [[0.00921161 0.90841171]
               [0.355636   0.18650262]]

              ```
            - Crop a raster using another raster mask:

              - Create a mask dataset with the same extent of the polygon we used in the previous example.

              ```python
              >>> geotransform = (0.1, 0.05, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, -0.05)
              >>> mask_dataset = Dataset.create_from_array(np.random.rand(2, 2), geo=geotransform, epsg=4326)

              ```
            - Then use the mask dataset to crop the dataset.

              ```python
              >>> cropped_dataset_2 = dataset.crop(mask=mask_dataset)
              >>> print(cropped_dataset_2.shape)
              (4, 2, 2)

              ```
            - Check the cropped dataset:

              ```python
              >>> print(cropped_dataset_2.geotransform)
              (0.1, 0.05, 0.0, -0.1, 0.0, -0.05)

        This is particularly useful for categorical raster data, such as land cover classifications,

        Notes:

            band (int):
                Band index.

        Examples:
            - First create a dataset:

              ... cell_size=0.05, rows=10, columns=10, dtype="float32", bands=1,

              ... )

              ```

            - Create a DataFrame with the attribute table:

              >>> df = pd.DataFrame(data)

            - Set the attribute table to the dataset:

              ```python
              >>> dataset.set_attribute_table(df, band=0)

              ```

            - Then the attribute table can be retrieved using the `get_attribute_table` method.
            - The content of the attribute table will be stored in an xml file by the name of the

              ... cell_size=0.05, rows=10, columns=10, dtype="float32", bands=1,

                          File:...
              <BLANKLINE>

              ```

            - Create a 2D array to add as a new band:

              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> array = np.random.rand(10, 10)

              ```

            - Add the new band to the dataset inplace:

              ```python
              >>> dataset.add_band(array, unit="m", attribute_table=None, inplace=True)
              >>> print(dataset)
              <BLANKLINE>

              ```

            - The new band will be added to the dataset inplace.
            - You can also add an attribute table to the band when you add a new band to the
              dataset.

              ```python
              >>> import pandas as pd
              >>> data = {
              ...     "Value": [1, 2, 3],

              ```

        Examples:
            - Create `Dataset` consists of 4 bands, 10 rows, 10 columns, at the point lon/lat (0, 0).

              ```python
              >>> import numpy as np
              >>> arr = np.random.randint(1, 12, size=(10, 10))
              >>> print(arr)    # doctest: +SKIP
              [[ 4  1  1  2  6  9  2  5  1  8]
               [ 1 11  5  6  2  5  4  6  6  7]
               [ 5  2 10  4  8 11  4 11 11  1]
               [ 2  3  6  3  1  5 11 10 10  7]
               [ 8  2 11  3  1  3  5  4 10 10]
               [ 1  2  1  6 10  3  6  4  2  8]
               [ 9  5  7  9  7  8  1 11  4  4]
               [ 7  7  2  2  5  3  7  2  9  9]
               [ 2 10  3  2  1 11  5  9  8 11]
               [ 1  5  6 11  3  3  8  1  2  1]]
               >>> top_left_corner = (0, 0)
               >>> cell_size = 0.05
               >>> dataset = Dataset.create_from_array(arr, top_left_corner=top_left_corner, cell_size=cell_size, epsg=4326)

               ```

            - Now, let's get the histogram of the first band using the `get_histogram` method with the default
                parameters:
                ```python
                >>> hist, ranges = dataset.get_histogram(band=0)
                >>> print(hist)  # doctest: +SKIP
                [28, 17, 10, 15, 13, 7]
                >>> print(ranges)   # doctest: +SKIP
                [(1.0, 2.67), (2.67, 4.34), (4.34, 6.0), (6.0, 7.67), (7.67, 9.34), (9.34, 11.0)]

                ```
            - we can also exclude values from the histogram by using the `min_value` and `max_value`:
                ```python
                >>> hist, ranges = dataset.get_histogram(band=0, min_value=5, max_value=10)
                >>> print(hist)  # doctest: +SKIP
                [10, 8, 7, 7, 6, 0]
                >>> print(ranges)   # doctest: +SKIP
                [(1.0, 1.835), (1.835, 2.67), (2.67, 3.5), (3.5, 4.34), (4.34, 5.167), (5.167, 6.0)]

                ```
            - For datasets with big dimensions, computing the histogram can take some time; approximating the computation
                of the histogram can save a lot of computation time. When using the parameter `approx_ok` with a `True`
                value the histogram will be calculated from resampling the band or from the overviews if they exist.
                ```python
                >>> hist, ranges = dataset.get_histogram(band=0, approx_ok=True)
                >>> print(hist)  # doctest: +SKIP
                [28, 17, 10, 15, 13, 7]
                >>> print(ranges)   # doctest: +SKIP
                [(1.0, 2.67), (2.67, 4.34), (4.34, 6.0), (6.0, 7.67), (7.67, 9.34), (9.34, 11.0)]

                ```
            - As you see for small datasets, the approximation of the histogram will be the same as without approximation.

            blocksize: Internal tile size; power of 2 in [64, 4096].
            predictor: ``"YES"``/``"STANDARD"``/``"FLOATING_POINT"`` or 1/2/3.
            bigtiff: ``"IF_SAFER"`` (default), ``"YES"``, ``"NO"``,
                ``"IF_NEEDED"``.
            num_threads: Worker threads; ``"ALL_CPUS"`` or an int.
            overview_resampling: ``nearest``, ``average``, ``bilinear``,
                ``cubic``, ``cubicspline``, ``lanczos``, ``mode``,
                ``rms``, ``gauss``.
            overview_count: Number of overview levels (default: auto).
            overview_compress: Compression for overview IFDs.
            tiling_scheme: e.g., ``"GoogleMapsCompatible"`` for a
                web-optimized COG (EPSG:3857).
            zoom_level, zoom_level_strategy, aligned_levels: Advanced
                tiling-scheme knobs.
            resampling: Warp resampling when ``tiling_scheme`` or

            extra: Additional GDAL creation options as a mapping or
                legacy ``['KEY=VALUE', ...]`` list. Overrides
                conflicting kwargs.

        Returns:
            Path: The resolved destination path.

        Raises:
            ValueError: Invalid blocksize or unknown option key.
            FileNotFoundError: Parent directory does not exist.
            FailedToSaveError: GDAL CreateCopy failed.
            DriverNotExistError: GDAL build lacks the COG driver.

        Warnings:
            UserWarning: When the source looks categorical (integer
                dtype or has a color table) and ``overview_resampling``
                is an averaging method.

        Note:
            Setting ``tiling_scheme`` (e.g., ``GoogleMapsCompatible``)
            implies a specific SRS — ``target_srs`` is ignored in that
            case. A ``UserWarning`` is emitted if both are provided.

        Examples:
            - Write a compressed COG from an in-memory Dataset:
                ```python
                >>> import numpy as np  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> from pyramids.dataset import Dataset  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> arr = np.random.rand(256, 256).astype("float32")  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> ds = Dataset.create_from_array(  # doctest: +SKIP
                ...     arr, top_left_corner=(0, 0), cell_size=0.001, epsg=4326,
                ... )
                >>> out = ds.to_cog("out.tif", compress="ZSTD")  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> out.name  # doctest: +SKIP
                'out.tif'

                ```
            - Produce a web-optimized COG for a tile server:
                ```python
                >>> web = ds.to_cog("web.tif", tiling_scheme="GoogleMapsCompatible")  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> reopened = Dataset.read_file(web)  # doctest: +SKIP
                >>> reopened.epsg  # doctest: +SKIP
                3857

                ```
            - Forward additional GDAL options through `extra`:
                ```python
                >>> _ = ds.to_cog(  # doctest: +SKIP
                ...     "precise.tif",
                ...     compress="LERC",
                ...     extra={"MAX_Z_ERROR": 0.001},

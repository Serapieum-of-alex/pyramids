"""Lock primitives for safe concurrent access to GDAL/OGR handles.

Three shapes are exported:

* :class:`SerializableLock` — a pickleable lock keyed by a UUID token
  plus a process-wide ``WeakValueDictionary`` of ``token -> Lock``.
  Pickling only transmits the token, so unpickled copies in the same
  process map back to the same underlying :class:`threading.Lock`
  while different processes get independent locks. This is the shape
  rioxarray / xarray use for dask-backed IO and is the correct
  default for pyramids' lazy read paths.
* :class:`DummyLock` — a no-op lock that never blocks. Used when a
  caller passes ``lock=False`` to opt into lock-free reads (per-thread
  handle, no cross-thread mutex — good for cloud COG reads where
  GDAL's block cache is per-handle anyway).
* :func:`default_lock` — one-line factory that returns a fresh
  :class:`SerializableLock` in a single-process context, or a
  :class:`dask.distributed.Lock` when a running dask client is
  detected. Prefer this over direct instantiation when a method
  accepts ``lock=None`` as "use the right thing".

The dask import is gated: importing this module does not pull
``dask.distributed``. ``default_lock`` only imports it when it
actually needs to probe for a running client.

class SerializableLock:
    """Pickleable lock keyed by a UUID token.

    Each instance holds a single ``threading.Lock`` plus a token
    string. On pickle, only the token is serialized; on unpickle, if
    the same token is already resident in the current process's
    ``_LOCKS`` dict, the unpickled copy maps to the same underlying
    lock (safe for in-process dask schedulers). Otherwise it creates
    a new lock in the target process (correct for cross-process dask
    because different processes should not share a Python-level
    mutex).

    Modeled on :class:`xarray.backends.locks.SerializableLock`.

    Examples:
        - Two instances with the same token share the underlying lock:
            ```python
            >>> from pyramids.base._locks import SerializableLock
            >>> import pickle
            >>> a = SerializableLock()
            >>> b = pickle.loads(pickle.dumps(a))
            >>> a.lock is b.lock
            True

            ```
        - Different instances have different underlying locks:
            ```python
            >>> from pyramids.base._locks import SerializableLock
            >>> a = SerializableLock()
            >>> b = SerializableLock()
            >>> a.lock is b.lock
            False
